# Project: "What is this card size?"

**What is this card size?** is a tool that I created to help me identify the size of a card in my board game projects.

Right now, the tool is very simple. You can adjust the size of the card in your screen and compare it with the card that you have in your hand. The tool will show you the size of the card in millimeters precisely.

I hope you find this tool useful. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
